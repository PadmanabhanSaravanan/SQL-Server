### What is Database ?

An organized collection of data stored in electronic format 

**Database Management System**<!-- style="font-size:20px;" -->

Database management System is software which is used to store and retrieve the database. 

* DBMS provides the interface to perform the various operations like creation, deletion, modification, etc.
* DBMS allows the user to create their databases as per their requirement.
* DBMS accepts the request from the application and provides specific data through the operating system.
* DBMS contains the group of programs which acts according to the user instruction.
* It provides security to the database.

**Relational Database Management System**<!-- style="font-size:20px;" -->

A relational database is the most commonly used database. It contains several tables, and each table has its primary key.

Due to a collection of an organized set of tables, data can be accessed easily in RDBMS.    

### What is SQL Server ?

SQL Server is a relational database management system, or RDBMS, developed and marketed by Microsoft.

Similar to other RDBMS software, SQL Server is built on top of SQL, a standard programming language for interacting with relational databases. SQL Server is tied to Transact-SQL, or T-SQL, the Microsoftâ€™s implementation of SQL that adds a set of proprietary programming constructs.

**SQL Server Architecture** <!-- style="font-size:25px;" -->

SQL Server consists of two main components:

* Database Engine
* SQLOS

**Database Engine**<!-- style="font-size:20px;" -->

The core component of the SQL Server is the Database Engine. 

The Database Engine consists of a relational engine that processes queries and a storage engine that manages database files, pages, indexes, etc. The database objects such as stored procedures, views, and triggers are also created and executed by the Database Engine.

**SQLOS**<!-- style="font-size:20px;" -->(SQL Server Operating System)

SQLOS provides many operating system services such as memory and I/O management. Other services include exception handling and synchronization services.
